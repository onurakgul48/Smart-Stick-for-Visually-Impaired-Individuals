#### Smart Stick for the Visually Impaired

## Introduction:
The Smart Stick is a walking aid designed to assist visually impaired individuals by detecting obstacles and water hazards. It uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles within a 2-meter range and a water detection sensor to identify water hazards. When the stick detects an obstacle or water, it warns the user with an audio message such as "obstacle detected" or "water detected."

## Features:

Obstacle detection within 20 cm (about 7.87 inches) using an ultrasonic sensor
Water detection using a water detection sensor
Audio warnings for detected obstacles or water hazards
Easy-to-assemble components

## Components:

Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
Water detection sensor
Arduino Uno or similar microcontroller
Buzzer
Speaker for audio warnings
LED indicator
Jumper wires and breadboard for connections

## Usage:

Power on the Smart Stick, and it will automatically start detecting obstacles and water hazards. When an obstacle or water is detected, the stick will provide an audio warning to alert the user.

## Future Enhancements:

Integrating all components inside the stick for a more compact and user-friendly design
Adding a GPS (Global Positioning System) module for navigation assistance
Implementing additional sensors to improve detection capabilities
